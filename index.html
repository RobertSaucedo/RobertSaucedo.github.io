    <h1>Hello My Name Is Robert</h1>

  	<p>I am a 15 year old boy who likes to hang out with friends and play sports.
  	My favorite sport would be either baseball or soccer because those sports have a lot of action. 
  	I am a sophomore in high school and I have plenty of friends who support me through school.

    <h2> First scratch Project </h2>

  	<p>The first scratch project I did was based on my favorite sport, baseball. What I did was get pictures of professional baseball players running and put it so that they would run the bases with a baseball flying.
    <h3> Second Scratch Project </h3>

    <p> My next scratch project is a remix of a game called 24.
    The goal of this educational game is to add, multiply, divide, or subtract the numbers on your screen so that it equals the number 24.
    This project was made by recreating the game as well as adding some alterations such as the new color and the amount of levels for endless fun.

    <h4> Mobile App Project </h4>
    <a href="https://repl.it/EABg/1">
    <img src="portfolio/images/replit screenshot.PNG"> </img> </a>
    <p> This is the app project that me and my paartner worked on. 
    This app is a remake of the mobile app game, trivia crack, that we added onto and made our own rules and gameplay.
    We have set the code to ask you a randomly selected question from the list of questions we have come up with while working on the project. 
    I think that we did a good job on this project because we used our time wisely in class and also managed to come up with a good amount of code for the project in order to make it work. </p>
