    <h1>Hello My Name Is Robert</h1>
    <img src="images/IMG_4920.jpg" height="250">
	
  	<p>I am a 15 year old boy who likes to hang out with friends and play sports.
  	My favorite sport would be either baseball or soccer because those sports have a lot of action. 
  	I am a sophomore in high school and I have plenty of friends who support me through school.

    <h2> First scratch Project </h2>
  	<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118975566/"> 
  	<img src= "portfolio/images/Scratch project 1.PNG" > </img> </a>
  	<p>The first scratch project I did was based on my favorite sport, baseball. What I did was get pictures of professional baseball players running and put it so that they would run the bases with a baseball flying.
    <h3> Second Scratch Project </h3>
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120241659/">
    <img src="portfolio/images/Second Scratch Project.PNG"> </img> </a>
    <p> My next scratch project is a remix of a game called 24.
    The goal of this educational game is to add, multiply, divide, or subtract the numbers on your screen so that it equals the number 24.
    This project was made by recreating the game as well as adding some alterations such as the new color and the amount of levels for endless fun.

    <h4> Mobile App Project </h4>
    <a href="https://repl.it/EABg/1">
    <img src="portfolio/images/replit screenshot.PNG"> </img> </a>
    <p> This is the app project that me and my partner worked on. 
    This app is a remake of the mobile app game, trivia crack, that we added onto and made our own rules and gameplay.
    We have set the code to ask you a randomly selected question from the list of questions we have come up with while working on the project. 
    I think that we did a good job on this project because we used our time wisely in class and also managed to come up with a good amount of code for the project in order to make it work. </p>
    
    <h5> 3.2.7 Data Plot Project </h5>
    <a href="3.2.7 Robert Navarro and Robert Saucedo.zip">
    <img src="portfolio/images/Screenshot of graphs.png"> </img>
    </a>
    
    <p> For this project, we came up with two graphs that show the comparison between technology used in law enforcement. We also set a timeline on a 
  scatterplot that shows the crime rates to see if they were going up or down. The design statment we were given explained how crime rates have dropped due to the fact that 
  law enforcement has been improving technology in order to prevent crimes.</p>
  
    <h6> 4.2.3 Simulation Project </h6>
    <a href="4.2.3 Robert Saucedo and Lainey Watlington.zip">
    <img src="images/423.png"> </img>
    </a>
    <p>For this project, we created a simulation which related to the article,"Prince", that was 
    written by Machiovelli and supported his ideals on what a perfect leader is. We did this by 
    providing a simulation which showed how if a leader is feared, then less rebels would rise up and 
    overthrow the leader. Every skull on the simulation represents an execution of rebels which also supports the idea 
    that a leader should do anything to stay in power.</p>
