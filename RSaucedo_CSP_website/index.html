	<p>I am a 14 year old boy who likes to hang out with friends and play sports. My favorite sport would be either baseball or soccer because those sports have a lot of action. I am a sophomore in high school and I have plenty of friends who support me through school.

	<p>The first scratch project I did was based on my favorite sport, baseball. What I did was get pictures of professional baseball players running and put it so that they would run the bases with a baseball flying.

  <p> My next scratch project is a remix of a game called 24. The goal of this educational game is to add, multiply, divide, or subtract the numbers on your screen so that it equals the number 24.This project was made by recreating the game as well as adding some alterations such as the new color and the amount of levels for endless fun.
